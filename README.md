# Stock_Comparison

The purpose of this project is to collect information regarding any two stocks and display that information in the form of Graphs and Tables. This information will include the Stock Price History and month-to-month returns over any desired number of months or years.

The desired data is collected using the yfinance module, which allows us to collect a wide range of information of any stock on Yahoo Finance. The information collected for this project includes the Stock Price History, of 52 Week Change, MarketCap, trailingPE, Dividend Rate etc.

The information is then displayed to the user through Tables and Graphs using Python Libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas. 

This is a small personal project with the purpose of allowing me to practice using Python and Libraries useful working with data such as Matplotlib and Pandas.
Any advice on how to make this program function more effectively would be greatly apprecieated.
